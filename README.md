### Description
This is a playground that I created, and been using since I started coding at age 15 to practice all types of data structures and algorthms for fun


I love learning complex fascinating concepts and theory when it comes to Data Structures and Algorithms. My main motivation for learning, and building using these data structures and algorithms is to be the best developer/Problem Solver that I could possibly be. I want to be able to develop effecient, clean, and maintianable web applications. I like to use what I learn and try to apply/implement it in different programming languages I am fluent in as well. It helps me remember the theory, algorithm it self, and it helps me to stay diverse in programming in different languages and syntaxes.
